## Split Testing
- To identify the best combination of variables with multiple Ad sets
  - One variable per Ad set 
  - To identify the cause of the success or failure from campaign to campaign
- It's an example of hypothesis testing
- Test different version of creatives and targeting audiences with A/B split testings

### Manual split testing Ad set level
- Different ad sets based on age, location, placement, gender, connections, audience, lookalike audience and detailed targeting 
- Create your campaign with best variable you think will work first and then create Ad sets for split testing 
- Target different interests like dog, cats and parrot in duplicate ad sets
- After 1000 ad impression, we can check which one is working the best 
- Exclude audiences at the ad level to avoid audience overlap issues
- Name ad set based on variable you are working so that we can easily identify
- Use duplicate option just to change the variable and create new ad sets 
- Analyse the ad sets result from the breakdown menu
